# Beta-Bank
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer of Beta Bank will leave the bank in the future, based on their historical behavior and available data. Using a dataset that includes information such as age, account balance, and whether the customer has canceled their contract, a predictive model should be created to maximize the F1 score (with a minimum of 0.59). Additionally, the model will be evaluated with other metrics like AUC-ROC.
